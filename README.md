# 1️⃣🚀 How to Reproduce the Complete Results

To fully replicate this project end-to-end, **run the notebooks in the following order**:

1️⃣ **01 — Initial Assignment Analysis**  
➡️ Loads + cleans data  
➡️ Generates MPNet text embeddings  
➡️ Attaches metric-name embeddings  
➡️ Runs PCA/UMAP embedding analysis  
➡️ Saves all preprocessed features for later use  

2️⃣ **02 — Model Development Phase**  
➡️ Builds baseline models (Linear, LGBM, CatBoost, SVR, MLP)  
➡️ Experiments with balancing methods (oversampling, weighted models, GPML, etc.)  
➡️ Introduces negative sampling + synthetic low-score generation  
➡️ Trains LightGBM on augmented features  

3️⃣ **03 — Final Model & Evaluation**  
➡️ Loads augmented full feature set  
➡️ Trains the heteroscedastic MLP  
➡️ Performs 5-fold GroupKFold CV  
➡️ Computes μ and σ² predictions  
➡️ Generates final test predictions and submission CSV

### 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to **predict human judge scores (0–10)** for LLM responses based on:

- **System prompt**  
- **User prompt**  
- **LLM response text**  
- **Safety metric name**  

Using:

- MPNet multilingual embeddings  
- Metric-name embeddings  
- Augmented negative samples  
- LightGBM  
- Final heteroscedastic neural network  

All steps together reproduce the full pipeline and leaderboard results.


# 2️⃣ **Dataset & Preprocessing**

### Files
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `train_data.json` | 5000 labeled samples |
| `test_data.json` | 3638 unlabeled samples |
| `metric_names.json` | 145 safety metric names |
| `metric_name_embeddings.npy` | 145 × 768 metric embeddings |

### Preprocessing Steps
- Remove `"None"` and normalize whitespace  
- Replace missing system prompts with empty strings  
- Map metric names → integer IDs  
- Attach their 768-dim embeddings  
- Build combined text strings for embedding  
- Save `notebook1_full_dump.joblib` for reproducibility

# 3️⃣ **Embedding Pipeline**

### 📌 MPNet Model  
`paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2`

- Supports multilingual text (Hindi, Tamil, English…)  
- Produces high-quality 768-dim embeddings  
- Handles long inputs using:  
  - **512-token window**  
  - **256-token stride**  
  - Weighted average of chunk embeddings  

### 📊 Embedding Quality Check
- PCA and UMAP show **score does not directly correlate with embedding space**  
- k-NN regression baseline RMSE ≈ **0.89** → meaningful signal present  

---

# 4️⃣ **Baseline Models**

Baseline feature-engineered models:

| Model | Performance |
|-------|-------------|
| Linear Regression | RMSE ≈ 0.936 |
| LightGBM | RMSE ≈ 0.894 |
| CatBoost Classifier | Macro-F1 ≈ 0.107 |

All **collapse to scores 9–10** due to dataset imbalance.

---

# 5️⃣ **Failed Balancing Attempts**

Several attempts were made to force the model to learn low-score behavior:

- Oversampling minority classes (failed → duplicate samples)  
- Embedding interpolation (failed → unrealistic samples)  
- Weighted MLPs  
- Weighted SVR  
- Gaussian Process Meta-Learning + CatBoost  

All produced RMSE: **3.7–3.9**  
Still collapsed into high-score distribution.

---

# 6️⃣ **Negative Sampling Strategy (Major Breakthrough)**

We introduce realistic low-scoring samples:

1. **Mismatched text embeddings**  
2. **Embeddings with Gaussian noise**  
3. **Metric-mismatched embeddings**

All synthetic samples assigned **score 0–2**.  

After augmentation, the training distribution becomes **balanced** and models begin learning meaningful low-score patterns.
